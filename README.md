 * CMake version 3.6.2 or later from https://cmake.org/install/.
 * Windows:
    - OpenSSL 1.0.2j (or later) -> either built from source or as pre-built package, for example from https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html.
    - Bonjour Mdns/dnssd (Multicast Domain Name System) client library (included)
 * Linux:
    - OpenSSL 1.0.2j (or later) -> (```sudo apt-get install libssl-dev```).
    - Avahi 0.61 (or later) libdnssd compatibility layer -> (```sudo apt-get install libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev```)
 
## Building the LDS

```bash
- mkdir <build-folder>
- cd <build-folder>
- cmake ..
- cmake --build .
```

## Runtime Dependencies
